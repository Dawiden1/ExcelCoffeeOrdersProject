# ExcelCoffeeOrdersProject
Coffee Sales Dashboard made in Excel using Pivot Table and analytics formulas 

This project aimed to prepare a dashboard about coffee sales in relation to a time period, the amount of money spent by specific individuals by country. Additional variables are the types of coffee roasts, the possession of a loyalty card and the size of the coffee package purchased.

In this project, I used a pivot table and several functions (e.g. MATCH, INDEX, IF, VLOOKUP).

There are 10 sheets in the file, divided into 4 colors:
- yellow - final dashboard
- blue - pivot tables used to create the dashboard
- green - transformed data
- orange - input data
